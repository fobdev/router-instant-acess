What the program do:

1 - Gets command 'ipconfig' information and puts it in a "ip" file;
2 - Searchs for the first that is written the default gateway;
3 - Delete every character of the line but the raw default gateway adress;
4 - Creates a string from the adress;
5 - Opens the string in the default user browser;
6 - Deletes the "ip.txt" file, as it is only necessary for searching.
